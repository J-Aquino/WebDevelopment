First Project: Conversation Starter ***I am in no way connected to HelloTalk in regards to the company or their products, just a user*** 
There is a great language learning app that is available called HelloTalk, where you can communicate with both native speakers and other learners. The difficult part of any new language is getting over the nerves of having a conversation, and well, actually speaking the language. Since I am a Spanish language learner, I focused on Spanish. This tool that I developed essentially will serve the following purpose:
  -No need to think of what to talk about, at the click of a button, it will generate a topic of conversation (in development)
  -Developed in mind for both English and Spanish speakers, allowing a user to switch between seeing the application in either language (default being english, dropdown menu       allows to switch to spanish (in development)
  
I chose using React just to kind of play with it, and get a sense of using it as a framework. From what I know it's not a pure React application, as far as implementation goes.
